Contract Management Project

This project is built using .NET 8 and follows a microservices architecture, with a backend API and a frontend using Next.js. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a hands-on educational tool for managing contracts, including several key features such as:

    Contracting Party Management: Manage the details of contracting parties.
    Contract Definition: Create and manage new contracts.
    Contract Reporting: Generate various reports for contracts.
    Contract Renewal: Extend existing contracts.
    Contract Expiry Notifications: Notify users of upcoming contract expirations.
